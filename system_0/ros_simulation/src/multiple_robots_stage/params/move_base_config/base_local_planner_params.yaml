  #The robot is not holonomic

  #Set the tolerance on achieving a goal
  xy_goal_tolerance: 0.1
  yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.05

  #We'll configure how long and with what granularity we'll forward simulate trajectories
  #too high sim time results in robot not being able to reach the goal - it keeps rolling around it (??) weird. also, it causes the problem of using shortcuts
  # (this could probably be adjusted by careful setting of occdist, gdist and pdist values)

  #We'll use the Dynamic Window Approach to control instead of Trajectory Rollout for this example
  # no, keep it to trajectory rollout: it keeps the plan deterministic, more reliable for difficult environments, although more computationally expensive
  dwa: false
